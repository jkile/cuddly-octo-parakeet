# HTML Refactor
HTML Refactor

This project was spent replacing div elements to semantic elements where they would help make the markup
more desciptive of what is reflected in  the content. Additionally, some changes were made to the CSS identifiers to account for the changes in the tags as well as alt tags being added to images and a fix on one of the nav bar anchor links.
